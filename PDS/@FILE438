//*      These macros can help you create new programs and          *   FILE 438
//*      modify existing code by supporting IF-THEN-ELSE logic      *   FILE 438
//*      while requiring only a small learning curve from what      *   FILE 438
//*      you already know about S/390 Assembler (assuming that      *   FILE 438
//*      you do know it already).  Each 'IF' statement can be       *   FILE 438
//*      arbitrarily complex, and the 'IF' statements can be        *   FILE 438
//*      nested as many levels as you might need. (Certainly,       *   FILE 438
//*      no one would need more than 255 levels of nesting,         *   FILE 438
//*      would he?)                                                 *   FILE 438

//*      Each group of instructions that you want conditionally     *   FILE 438
//*      executed would be headed by an 'IF' macro, and             *   FILE 438
//*      terminated by an 'ENDIF' macro.                            *   FILE 438

//*      In its simplest form, the operand of the 'IF' macro        *   FILE 438
//*      consists of an op-code, the first operand address,         *   FILE 438
//*      the second operand address, and a condition. These         *   FILE 438
//*      four values must be enclosed within parentheses, and       *   FILE 438
//*      following the operands must be a comma and the             *   FILE 438
//*      statement terminating term 'THENDO'.                       *   FILE 438

//*      The op-code may be any valid S/390 op-code that sets       *   FILE 438
//*      the condition code. The first and second operands may      *   FILE 438
//*      be any values that are valid for the instruction           *   FILE 438
//*      being created. The condition, such as 'E' or 'NO', is      *   FILE 438
//*      any value that can be used in creating an extended         *   FILE 438
//*      mnemonic branch instruction (such as 'BE' or 'BNO').       *   FILE 438

//*      If you choose 'E' as the condition, then the group of      *   FILE 438
//*      instructions between the 'IF' and the 'ENDIF' will be      *   FILE 438
//*      executed only if the condition code set by the             *   FILE 438
//*      op-code and operands specified is a zero.                  *   FILE 438
//*                                                                 *   FILE 438
//*      In the following examples, the heading will indicate       *   FILE 438
//*      the conditions in which the do-group will be               *   FILE 438
//*      executed. In each case, an 'IF' statement determines       *   FILE 438
//*      the conditions, and an 'ENDIF' statement terminates        *   FILE 438
//*      the do-group. Comments either in the heading or on         *   FILE 438

//*      perform other categories of function, as well as the       *   FILE 438
//*      ones which can be used to create structured assembler      *   FILE 438

//*      In the following list of macros, each one is assigned to   *   FILE 438
//*      a category according to its intended use.  Most of the     *   FILE 438
//*      testing on these macros has been done in an environment    *   FILE 438
//*      called 'Version 2', or '2nd Generation'.  This             *   FILE 438
//*      environment presents a programmer with a pseudo-COBOL      *   FILE 438
//*      way of coding, and was created in the early 1990's as an   *   FILE 438
//*      aid to getting programs going faster.  The 'Version 1'     *   FILE 438
//*      or '1st Generation' environment was created in the mid     *   FILE 438
//*      1970's, and is somewhat more oriented toward Systems       *   FILE 438

//*      DIAGNOSTIC - The macro may be used in either Version 1     *   FILE 438
//*      or 2 programs, and is intended primarily as a diagnostic   *   FILE 438
//*      aid in getting the program running correctly.  Hopefully   *   FILE 438
//*      the effort expended in using one or more of these          *   FILE 438
//*      diagnostic macros will pay off in diagnosing the           *   FILE 438

//*      (presumably during the finalization step of the            *   FILE 438
